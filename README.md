# LBPH Face Recognition System

This project uses the **LBPH (Local Binary Pattern Histograms)** face recognition algorithm to identify individuals. It consists of two main parts:
1. **Training Process**: A model is trained using a face dataset to recognize faces.
2. **Testing and Recognition Process**: The trained model is used to recognize faces in a test image, and the results are displayed on the screen.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV (Face Detection and Recognition)
- Numpy

## Installation

1. **Install Required Libraries**:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python numpy
   ```

2. **Training Data**:
   - Download the LFW (Labeled Faces in the Wild) dataset and place it in the `lfw-deepfunneled` folder.
   - You can download the LFW dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dbeley/lfw).

3. **Training**:
   To train the face recognition model, run the following command:
   ```bash
   python train_face_recognizer.py
   ```

   This will save the trained model as `face_recognizer.yml`.

4. **Testing**:
   To test the trained model, run the following command:
   ```bash
   python test_face_recognition.py
   ```

## File Structure
- `train_face_recognizer.py`: Python file for training the face recognition model.
- `test_face_recognition.py`: Python file for testing the face recognition model.
- `face_recognizer.yml`: The trained face recognition model.
- `lfw-deepfunneled/`: Folder containing images from the LFW dataset.

## Usage

1. Once the model is trained, you can use it to recognize faces in test images.
2. During the testing phase, the recognized personâ€™s name and confidence level will be displayed.

## Face Recognition Results

When the face recognition process is successful, you should see the following information:
- **Recognized Person**: The person identified by the model.
- **Confidence Level**: The confidence level of the model's prediction.
